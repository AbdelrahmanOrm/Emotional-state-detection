# Emotional-state-detection
The model presents EmoDetect, a deep learning model tailored for emotional speech state detection. By leveraging advanced neural network architectures and state-of-the-art techniques in speech processing, EmoDetect offers superior performance in recognizing emotional states from speech signals. The model's robustness, accuracy, and generalization capabilities make it well-suited for various applications, including affective computing, human-computer interaction, and mental health assessment. Future work will focus on further refining EmoDetect's architecture and exploring its integration into practical systems for real-world deployment.

### Project Overview
Objective: Build a machine learning model to classify emotions from audio voice data.

Scope: Emotion recognition from voice recordings to detect states such as happiness, sadness, anger, neutrality, etc.

Approach: Audio signal processing and feature extraction followed by training classification models.

Outcome: A trained model capable of predicting emotional states from new voice inputs with evaluated metrics.

### Dataset
The dataset consists of labeled voice recordings representing different emotional states.

Audio preprocessing and feature extraction are applied, capturing elements like Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs), pitch, and other acoustic features.

### Data Processing
Loading and preprocessing of audio files.

Extraction of relevant audio features suitable for emotion classification.

Splitting data into training and testing sets for model validation.

### Model Training
Training of machine learning classifiers such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forests, or Neural Networks.

Hyperparameter tuning for improved model performance.

Use of pipelines to streamline preprocessing and classification.

### Evaluation
Model performance assessed via metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Visualization of results for detailed analysis of classifier behavior per emotion category.

### Usage
Prepare voice data and labels following the projectâ€™s preprocessing approach.

Train or load a pre-trained model.

Use the model to predict emotions in new voice samples.
