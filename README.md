# Emotional-state-detection
The model presents EmoDetect, a deep learning model tailored for emotional speech state detection. By leveraging advanced neural network architectures and state-of-the-art techniques in speech processing, EmoDetect offers superior performance in recognizing emotional states from speech signals. The model's robustness, accuracy, and generalization capabilities make it well-suited for various applications, including affective computing, human-computer interaction, and mental health assessment. Future work will focus on further refining EmoDetect's architecture and exploring its integration into practical systems for real-world deployment.
